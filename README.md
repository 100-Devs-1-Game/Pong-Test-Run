Make sure to read the contributors guide before contributing.

Required Software:
[Godot v4.4.1](https://godotengine.org/download/)
[Git LFS](https://git-lfs.com/)
- Install Git LFS
- Run the `git lfs install` command anywhere
- Before adding large files make sure the extensions are within the `.gitattributes` file (or ask a programmer)
- Keep using git like usual

## For Programmers
[GDToolkit](https://github.com/Scony/godot-gdscript-toolkit?tab=readme-ov-file#installation)  ( Requires Python )
- Install Python
- Use Command Line `pip3 install "gdtoolkit==4.*"`

Recommended software (if you aren't sure what to pick):
- Git: [Github Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/download/)
- Editor: [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) full IDE with advanced functionality compared to the Godot Editor, but needs to be configured properly

For VSCode users:
[GDScript Formatter and Linter Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=EddieDover.gdscript-formatter-linter)

### Project specific Guidelines ( Programming )

- We are using a global Autoload Event/Signal Bus where all `signals` that aren't purely for intra-module communication will reside. If possible try to design your modules in away that they only communicate through those global signals with the outside.
- We are using Formatter and Linter plugins that will automatically re-format your code or point out potential Errors when you save your Scripts. This may cause some confusion and also trigger the "Newer Files on Disk" Dialog in the Godot Editor, where you can choose "Reload from Disk"
- It's against convention to use `_varialble` for variables that *are not* unused. Use `p_variable` instead if you run into issues, eg. in `_init()`
- We discourage the use of `await`, `set_deferred()` and `call_deferred()` unless you know exactly what you are doing and what the implications are. Best to leave a comment above that line to inform Code Reviewers why you think it's safe to use in your case.
